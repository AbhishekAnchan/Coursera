           Wireless SCADA deals with the creation of an inexpensive, yet adaptable and easy to use
           SCADA device and infrastructure using the mobile telephone network, in particular, the
           General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). The hardware components making up the device are
           relatively unsophisticated, yet the custom written software makes it re-programmable over
           the air, and able to provide a given SCADA application with the ability to send and receive
           control and data signals at any non predetermined time.
           GPRS is a packet-based radio service that enables “always on” connections, eliminating
           repetitive and time-consuming dial-up connections. It will also provide real throughput in
           excess of 40 Kbps, about the same speed as an excellent landline analog modem
           connection.
